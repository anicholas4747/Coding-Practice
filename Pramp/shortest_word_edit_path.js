// Shortest Word Edit Path
// Given two words source and, and a list of words words, find the length of the 
// shortest series of edits that transforms   to target.
// Each edit must change exactly one letter at a time, 
// and each intermediate word(and the final target word) must exist in words.
// If the task is impossible, return -1.

// Examples:

// source = "bit", target = "dog"
// words = ["but", "put", "big", "pot", "pog", "dog", "lot"]
// output: 5
// explanation: bit -> but -> put -> pot -> pog -> dog has 5 transitions.

// source = "no", target = "go" words = ["to"]
// output: -1
